% Problem Statement
Difficulty in travelling long distance journey in Kenya, due to high cost and unreliable services by public vehicles.

Going on a long distance journey is difficult in Kenya, if you do not own a car. The public means of transport are inconvenient and unreliable. During holidays, most people are stranded as the prices are hicked, the demand exceeds the supply. Apart from the Matatus most people prefer to hire cars. Hiring cars is expensive because they end up hiring the car for the days they will be away.

This is a big problem to the youths since most of them do not own cars and cannot afford to hire cars. The price of fuel has been increasing making transportation generally expensive for most people.

There is a need to connect people who are willing to share their cars with passengers during travelling. Currently private car drivers fear driving to the bus stations and pick passengers because they will spend a lot of time due to congestion at bus stations. In addition to that only authorized vehicles are allowed to pick passengers at the bus stations.

Passengers have a need to access private cars that are travelling from and to their destination. They need this information earlier so that they can prepare and plan their journey well.
